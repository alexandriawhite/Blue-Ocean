## Description
 This app was created for people that keep striking out on typical dating apps. Seeing this as a blue ocean opportunity, our team has decided to create the perfect solution! Together we worked to change the typical dating style by persuing a more love is blind approach so the user is able to actually get to know their potential match  before rating their physical appearance. There are a multitude of dating apps but we want to keep users from wasting time on the superficial aspects and find their true match.

## 📝 Notes
> Other dating apps:
> * Bumble: Matches only last 24 hours with the girl needing to message first. If the man does not respond after the initial message, the match disappears.
> * Hinge: Subscription needed for advanced filters. Even with premium accounts they are not always accurate. First message must come from the person that received the first like. 
> * The League: Exclusive app that requires admission. Only 5 matches allowed at a time.
> * Tinder: Primarily used for non commitment relationships
